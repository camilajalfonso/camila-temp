## May 19

Today I came home from Madrid. I spent the whole morning and afternoon sleeping because I was so hungover. I told my roommates in Zaragoza this, and they taught me the Spanish word for hangover: resaca. They found it funny that they could be my teacher - I tried to offer them a few English words as a form of trade, but I’m not sure they stuck.

We made plans tomorrow to hang out. They’re both nurses, and whether it has been intentional or not, the past few tenants have also been nurses. They were surprised to hear I was working at the local University in environmental outreach. They seemed more confused than impressed.

They’re from Huesca originally, but it seems they know their way around the city well. They both said there really wasn’t much for us to do in town. I’ve been here five days and that was not the first time I’d heard this.

I know I’m going to have a great summer. I already have so much planned and I’ve already met so many people. Tomorrow I’ll do my work at a cafe.

I’m talking to my friend Nico a lot. We’ve been texting and we seem to have a lot in common. Hopefully I’ll see him in August. We haven’t seen each other since high school, and we ran in different groups, so I didn’t ever know him very well. We started talking and it's like we’ve been best friends forever.

I miss Matthew, but in a less defined way than I used to. I don’t necessarily think back on specific memories anymore. I had this moment where I believed that I suffered more than he did, then vice versa, and now I don’t think it's worth measuring at all.

I want to only invest time in talking to people who I can learn from. Maybe that means everybody. This summer and onwards, I would like to place myself above the necessity to talk to guys, but then again, I am twenty two, and I am not perfect. This will be the start of my Summer journal.

## May 24

I'm on my way to Malaga right now. I’m sitting a few cars down from my boss on the train, and the seat next to me is empty. I’m covered in crumbs from the sandwich I brought with me, which I didn’t realize until I took this out and started writing. I’m passing so many cute little towns, and it reminds me of the scenery in California. I would imagine that a train ride to Santa Rosa would look like this, or maybe if it ever exists, a train up to Humboldt. Actually, I think the scenery that far up would be much more beautiful than what I’m seeing now. Sorry. I miss the North.

Being in Zaragoza these past two weeks has shown me that I prefer Spain over the United States at the moment. The Spanish economic structure is not entirely idyllic and it needs improvement, but it is not as overwhelming as the neoliberalism back home. Here, I notice there is a lower emphasis on work as a whole. Family and relationships take precedent, and travel is incredibly valuable. I think that in my twenties, this will be the best way to live.

The main reason I feel favorably towards Spanish politics is because of their stance on Palestine. I can’t express how it feels to leave a place like Madison, Wisconsin, where my old sorority would counter protest encampments, and arrive at a country where people comfortably denounce Israel in casual conversation. I feel shocked when people are open to talking about it, and knowingly talk about it. Being in Spain is similar to Argentina, in that sense. People enjoy entering uncomfortable political conversations, and it never really gets heated. They just have a more open culture around discourse. There are a number of other reasons that contribute to their education in American politics as well.

I heard from someone online that Keir Starmer of the Labor Party will replace Rishi Sunak, but that he is not far left enough to realistically stop arms to Israel or to address any of the issues that the Labor Party has historically represented. I also read about Jeremy Corbyn, and how he was exiled from the Labor Party and began his own Independent campaign because of his stance on Palestine. It seems that there is a left wave happening across Europe. Even in France, people are coming together against Macron’s centrism as much as they are against LePenne’s extremism. As I witness elections across the E.U., I am receptive to how they have a more collective society. I wouldn’t have the faith to describe my culture the same way.

I haven't bonded with my roommates, which is partly my fault. I should be more open, but weirdly, I’m so shy around them. Maybe it's because I think they wouldn’t like me. But, why is that?

I met Lea’s friends. They’re very Venezuelan, in their working class backgrounds, their orientation to consumption, and their nostalgia for their country. It is truly bleak to hear them miss where they are from. I have the privilege to choose where I want to go, and the privilege to not long for my life in California, because I know it will always be there for me. They don’t get that, and its partly due to how badly we’ve fucked their country with sanctions. On top of that, their oil infrastructure could use some work, and the United States has known this for a long time. The Venezuelan election is at the end of the Summer. Passport holders in the United States are not allowed to participate, and I think there are restrictions on other countries as well.

It’s strange. I identify as a Latina, but a huge part of that authentic identity is instability - being from the U.S. removes me from that trauma, even if I am still technically a part of the diaspora. When I hear others talk about it, like my mother, or my father, or Lea, or anyone else I have encountered in Spain who has immigrated from a Latin American country, I feel guilty. Like I should know what it is like, but they should have never gone through it. Like it's my fault but that is egocentric, like I should help, but that would be me exerting pity. It is strange. I find it all unfair, but then why do I think that my feelings matter?

I have to share a bed with my boss, which I do not want to do. I’m hoping that it's not a big deal, or that I can find my way out of it. I’m looking forward to Coin, but part of me is feeling how I did in April, at Lake Huron in Michigan. I know things are different here. I’m not a plus one to a man I hardly know, and who is incredibly difficult to know. I am with adults at an organized conference on Spain’s water infrastructure. I think it will take years before that American side of me, the one that cringes at kisses and prefers my seat empty, will go away.

I’m excited to take videos and I’m thrilled to see Malaga! I’m also looking forward to Monday off. I’ll be going to the gym, to the Basilica, and to see Dune 2.

## May 25

Good morning. I’m in Coin, a small village near Malaga. I was in a weird mood yesterday when we arrived, but I’m in better spirits now.

I’ve realized that I used to have a very American mentality with small towns. I wanted more “modern” or trendy coffee shops, or I wanted access to things in remote locations (like particular brands at rural grocery stores, or particular produce times when it is not in season). Now I am understanding the implication of that access. To have all that access is to exploit the means which provide this access. It is also an exploitation of the self, because it removes the ability for a person to know the true value of that access, the true cost of receiving a commodity. I no longer drink Coke Zero.

I have to go get breakfast with everyone. It's a little overwhelming being around so many adults, honestly. But some of them like me and that's enough. I didn't have to share a bed, thank god. This was all culminating to make me anxious, but as it turns out, I had nothing to fear.

I might stay here for a while. I’ll check the schedule and see how late I can go meet everyone.

## May 26

So I’m at the train station in Malaga. I didn't check my ticket, and when I got here at 8:10 in the morning, I noticed it was for around 2 O’clock. Much later! I went to change it with my new friend, a woman who got her M.A. in environmental studies at U.W. Madison. My boss introduced me to her at the dinner the Foundation was hosting, because she could see I was bored. I asked her to roll me a cigarette, which felt unnatural at first, but there is no shame in smoking here.

The front desk people told me it would be almost two hundred euros out of pocket. I had no interest in investing any money in a new ticket, given that my boss had purchased my original ones. My new friend said it would be nice for me to check out the beach, so I settled on that. I’m at a cafe at the bus station right now, drinking an americano even though I just had one, because I needed to break the change I got from the ATM to pay for a locker in coins. I am going to drop off my things before I run around Malaga.

I felt so prepared at the ATM - one card didn’t work, so I tried my other, which had money in it. Thank God! It's making me realize that having money is essential… I should always know this. It seems I discover this much too often.

Solo traveling around Europe is awesome. I’ve noticed I’m more introverted than I previously thought, but that’s because I always speak in Spanish, and so I feel less confident in my words. People are very welcoming anyways, and they find my attempts endearing. Sometimes I assure them that I don’t speak it very well, but most people insist that I communicate effectively. I think they’re used to the amount of dialects coming in from all the other Latin American immigrants of the twentieth century. Maybe they’re just flattering me, I speak like shit.

I’m so happy Ignacio gave me this journal, especially since it came with a pen. I’m going to write a lot!

Little update - I’m on the beach. I didn't bring a swimsuit so I’m in my underwear. It’s empty enough that I don’t feel self conscious. It doesn’t really matter. No one who walks the shore in front of me can really tell that I am in cotton, and with topless women around me, it seems I am the least of anybody’s worries. Anyways, this way I’ll get better tan lines.

I almost cried walking on the shore. I’m so happy. Last night was beautiful, and the Foundation I work for is truly amazing. They’re so supportive of one another, they are such good friends, and they care deeply for the planet and its resources. I had a moment in the auditorium where I realized: 1. How many people were there, and 2. How old they were. In a way, they are leaving me their planet. They want it to be better for everyone, even when they’re gone. They’re dedicating the last part of their life to make that happen.

Last night me and Nico talked about politics, and he said he was glad that we started talking. I feel the same. It’s nice to chat while I’m traveling, especially since he’s also in Europe. Not for long, though. Unfortunately. If he was, I would’ve made an effort to visit him.

It's also sweet to talk to someone from home. I miss California, but I miss it the way I do Matthew, like it was meant for me at a certain time, and I can’t figure out whether I want it anymore. The feeling is complex.

## May 27

This next week is the 2024 Parliament election in Spain, so my coworkers have been discussing their politics in the office more than the first week I was here. They have encouraged me to read more Spanish news, through the outlet El Pais, and I have been searching for local independent news stations.

Also, in somewhat recent news, Spain has demonstrated their intention to recognize Palestinian statehood and other EU countries such as Ireland have followed suit.

This weekend I went on a trip to Coín, Malaga and I got to know how smaller villages and towns have reacted to bureaucratic policies that have hindered their progress with modern water systems.

I have been comparing Spanish culture to my Californian roots and my Latin American culture. For example, here they use two kisses rather than one to greet people; however when I see my Venezuelan friends and family here, I only greet with one. I’ve noticed that with Americans I meet it is either a hug or a wave, which is culturally more distant from greetings in hispanic communities.

I think one value (which speaks to what I mentioned above) that has come up recently has been personal space. On the train or at the theater I find myself irritated when people sit next to me when there are available spaces, even though it truly is not that strange to be in such close proximity to people in communal spaces. I find this to be ingrained in me as an American, because although I'm comfortable with closer greetings, I prefer my distance from strangers.

A ritual I have found here is to separate the day in two, with a siesta. I have definitely assimilated in that aspect! And I truly think it is an effective and productive way to structure the day. It makes me think about how work ethic is considered in the U.S., where naps or breaks demonstrate laziness, whereas here it is a necessary break to take care of oneself - or, just a reward which one should not feel guilty giving oneself.
